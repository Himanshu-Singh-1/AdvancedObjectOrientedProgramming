# AdvancedObjectOrientedProgramming

Goal:
Implemented a template using macro for a double-ended queue without using C++ features. As a
template it can contain any type without using void* (which violates type safety). Deque was
implemented as a circular dynamic array. The functionalities to be implemented for deque had to
be inferred from a test code. Some of the functionalities were: iterator, sorting, equality of
deques. Other exhaustive stress tests were performed to check performance of deque in terms of
time and memory allocations.
