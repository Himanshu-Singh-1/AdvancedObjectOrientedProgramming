# AdvancedObjectOrientedProgramming

Following projects were implemented during advanced object oriented programming course:

1. Container Map: Implemented a container class template Map with functionalities that are a proper subset of standard
STL map class from C++ Standard Library.

2. Smart Pointer: Implemented a non-intrusive, thread-safe, exception-safe, reference-counting smart pointer similar to
STL shared pointer using C++.

Metaprogramming: 
3. Implemented container Arbitrary Dimension Array Class Variadic Template that can be instantiated with any number of dimensions.
4. Interpolate ostream which accepts arguments like Cs printf using C++17 features.
